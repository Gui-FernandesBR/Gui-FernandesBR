### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹


My name is Guilherme Fernandes, I'm a Brazilian developer and I'm currently working
on different open source projects, mainly two of them: 
- [**RocketPy**]() : A Python library for rocket trajectory analysis and optimization.
- [**Last-Mile-Routing-Analyzer**]() : A Python library for the analysis of last mile routing problems in urban areas.


As you may have noticed, I am mostly interest in Python :snake:. 
However, I am also interested in other topics, such as:
- :bar_chart: Data Science
- :earth_americas: Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  
- :truck: Transportation Engineering 

Rockets are my hobby, so far I could not find someone who disagrees with me when I say that rockets are awesome :rocket:.
